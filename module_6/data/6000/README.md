# Test Data set

I will use this data set for an assignment. 
The `world_salaries_6000.csv` contains oldest(?) 5999 salary records from the
[Salary Survey](https://www.askamanager.org/2021/04/how-much-money-do-you-make-4.html).
It is filled manually by internet users and thus is not clean enough. 
As a result it should meet module 6 assignment requirements.
