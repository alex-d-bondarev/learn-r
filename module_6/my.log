It took me 2 days to find a data set that I can understand and that meets the following criteria:
1. Your data set should have at least 700, but less than 6000, records
2. eight (8) attributes and the data should not be “clean”. Part of this assignment will require you to clean the data yourself.
Item no.2 was the hardest. Almost all data sets I found so far were cleaned or did not make sense to me.
The "Salary Survey" looks promising
